When Ben steals an envelope with his dad's address, he can finally uncover the life of a man he has never known and learn what this stranger means to him. Ben’s discovery will ultimately challenge his identity and cause him to question his childhood. </p>

					<h3 style='text-align: left'> Why are we telling this story? </h3>
					<br>
					<p class='storydesc'>All of us harbor very personal stories about our families. My family has its own share of secrets. These unique and complex relationships with family members shape who we are and how we perceive the world around us. Ben Garber is caught amidst the confusion and heartache that his family’s secrets have borne.  Despite his mother’s efforts, Ben’s desire to know his father is overwhelming. When Ben finally discovers his dad’s whereabouts, he can uncover how the course of his life might have changed had his father always been in his life.
					<br><br>
					I believe we all have our own specific stories about our families that stir both great pain but also immense joy within us – the <span style='font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> what if </span> and <span style='font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;'> if only </span> moments. ‘And We Fell’ is a story about family, and how our identities are tied to our families. The film poses two questions: ‘What defines our identity?’ and ‘How do we come to terms with the mistakes of our parents?’  
					<br><br>
					This story allows for complexity within the characters’ lives. It is my desire to create a film where all the characters believe they are doing the right thing. They are multifaceted characters much like us. Ben is right to pursue his father. Samantha, his mother, is right to keep Ben away from him. And Joe, Ben’s father, is right in his choice to stay hidden.  No person ever thinks of themselves as the villain, and I believe neither should your characters. I hope that this allows the audience to access the emotion of each of the characters and be an active viewer in their specific journeys. 
					<br><br>
					I believe at a minimum a movie should seek to entertain, but should ultimately strive to incite emotion within an audience. As a team, we are attacking this goal head on. Thank you so much for your support.</p>
