					<h3 style='text-align: left'> Why are we telling this story? </h3>
					<br>
					<p class='storydesc'>This film came to life after co-writer Stephanie Nilles and myself came to a crossroads with a previous script. We had engineered a story with a well-constructed plot, yet it lacked an emotional grounding that spoke to both us. We needed a story with a strong emotional heartbeat – something that could devastate us yet also reveal the joys that life provides.<br><br>
					We talked openly about our pasts and the events that have formed us as individuals. We kept circling two topics in our discussions – one being family and the other being a revealing urge to take over someone’s life, to step into another person’s shoes even for a day.  ‘And We Fell’ came from a desire to connect these two threads of emotional honesty in our lives. <br><br>
					All of us harbor very personal stories about our families. These unique and complex relationships with family members shape who we are and how we perceive the world around us. For our protagonist Ben, he is driven by a desire to escape his home life, to construct an imagined reality that can separate him from the suffocating grief gripping his family. Ben’s focus on Lucas’s picture-perfect family allows him to restore his emotional world to a previous time, when happiness seemed easier to come by.  He simply wants to step into Lucas’ shoes and allow his mind to capture what he used to feel everyday prior to his father’s passing.  For Ben, it seems to be a simple request, but as the people around him begin to challenge his fantasy, he is forced to confront the emotions he has been running from.<br><br>
					Ben’s desire is simple and quite universal: <span style='font-style: italic;'> The world keeps spinning, but sometimes you just want it to stop.</span><br><br>
					I believe at a minimum a movie should seek to entertain, but should ultimately strive to incite emotion within an audience.  As a team, we are attacking this goal head on.  Thank you so much for your support.</p>
