						<p class='quotesignature'> - Benjamin Till, "And We Fell" </p>
						<h1 class='storyheadline'>The Story</h1>
						<p class='storydesc'>Ben and Samantha are two hard-luck individuals with a child on the way.  Abandoned by their families and plagued by past transgressions, they have always looked to one another for support.  The two concoct a desperate scheme to rob the home of Ben’s estranged half-brother. Yet, when the robbery goes horribly awry, their pursuit of redemption might ultimately prove to haunt them.</p>
						<p class='storydesc'>‘And We Fell’ explores how family bonds influence our decision-making. The film asks - What is our duty to family and how do these responsibilities transform us as people?</p>
						<h1 id="director">Director's Statement</h1>
						<h3 style='text-align: left'> Why are we telling this story? </h3>
						<br>
						<p class='storydesc'>One word: Family.  That single word brings so many emotions to the surface for people, inciting laughter, pain, anger, joy, etc. All of us harbor very personal stories about our families. These unique and complex relationships with family members shape who we are and how we perceive the world around us. We want to share a story that is willing to explore the messier side of family dynamics. Often we strive to embrace familial relationships, but sometimes we find ourselves running away from them. <br><br>
						This is very true for our main characters, Ben and Samantha. They are people who desperately want to be good parents but are deeply influenced by the failings of the men and women who brought them into the world.  Ben longs to escape the sins of his father. Samantha looks to her grandmother for inspiration due to the absence of both her mother and father. Yet, at the center of their relationship is the upmost desire to make a better life for their child. <br><br>
						Our story seeks to convey an honest and heartfelt portrayal of the legacies parents leave for their children. We want to tell a story about family that isn’t cookie-cutter or neat. ‘And We Fell’ is grounded in reality. It is complex and raw. And it allows for the characters to be flawed and emotional. Please help us to tell this story, which reflects an affecting and unique perspective on family. <br><br>

						<span style='font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; color: #5486a1'> ‘Family quarrels are bitter things. They don’t go according to any rules. They’re not like aches or wounds, they’re more like splits in the skin that won’t heal because there’s not enough material.’ <br> </span>  – F. Scott Fitzgerald</p>
